## Installation
Play the game on its Github deployment [Here](https://krestle80.github.io/cardCity/), or clone it off of GitHub and open the index.html file in your browser
## Usage Information
The entire game so far is point and click. Right now sometimes the ai causes a major bug that errors out the game, I'm working on smoothing it out, but if something does happen a quick reload will fix it, at the cost of all of your progress
