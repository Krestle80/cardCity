# Card City
## Description
The goal for the project is to create a turn based strategy card game, I would like for the player to be able to: place buildings via cards, to earn a variety of recources, as well as specific cards from said buildings, place units using cards, move units already on the field, and be able to attack both enemy units and buildings with player units. 

update v 0.0.1:

### The game screen seen above contains a Top display bar whith these items in order from left to right: 
<p style = "text-align : center; margin-top: 20px;"> gold <p>
<p style = "text-align : center;">gold earned perturn in paraenteses<p>
<p style = "text-align : center;">Tech Per Turn in paraenteses<p>
<p style = "text-align : center; margin-bottom: 20px;"> End turn button which is completely red<p>


### The board contains: 
<p style = "text-align : center; margin-top: 20px;"> 60 tiles half of which are the players (blue) and the other half the ais(red)<p>
<p style = "text-align : center;">Units, the arrows, white for the player, and black for the ai, with values such as Health which is represented by the red bars on the top bar of the arrow<p>
<p style = "text-align : center;">Units also have values for movement, attack strength, alignment, and tile position<p>
<p style = "text-align : center;" > Buildings, right now they are all solid colors, forts, in dark blue, and Settlements, in orange for the player, and black for the ai<p>
<p style = "text-align : center; margin-bottom: 20px;"> Building values include Health, alignment, gold per turn, and tech per turn<p>
### The player can now: 
<p style = "text-align : center;">Earn and spend Gold<p>
<p style = "text-align : center;">Earn Tech Points (only from settlement right now)<p>
<p style = "text-align : center; margin-top: 20px;">Place Cards on the board (dark blue tiles(forts) on the blue side and white arrow(maniples))<p>
<p style = "text-align : center;">Select unit to move or attack enemy units<p>
<p style = "text-align : center; margin-bottom: 20px;">End turn to recharge unit energy and attack, and gain gold/ tech per turn at their respective rates<p>

### The ai can now: 
<p style = "text-align : center; margin-top: 20px;"> place units <p>
<p style = "text-align : center;">place forts<p>
